In this lab activity we are going to use the `attitude` dataset, which is already loaded into R. 

**1.** Run `help("attitude")` to get some info on the data and the meaning of each variable. You can also run `View(attitude)` to 

```{r include=FALSE}
# View(attitude)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# summary(fm2 <- lm(rating ~ complaints, data = attitude))
```
