## Why Interactions?

The idea of interaction is that the effect two predictors $X_1$ and $X_2$ have on an outcome $Y$ is fundamentally tied together. 

- More specifically, the effect that $X_1$ has on $Y$ depends on the value of $X_2$, and the effect that $X_2$ has on $Y$ depends on the value of $X_1$.

A very clear example of an interaction effect is how an individual's gender and race jointly affect number of experienced daily microagressions. Looking at gender and race separately would miss much of the picture (intersectionality!)

If we believe that two variables should interact in how they influence $Y$, we can express that with the regression model:

$$
\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3(X_1 \times X_2) 
$$





## By the way, Interaction or Moderation? 

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:35px; padding-bottom:14px;">  Interaction and moderation are the same exact thing.</div>

I prefer the term *interaction* to avoid confusion with the term *mediation*, which has absolutely nothing to do with anything discussed in this Lab. That being said ...


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}


When hypothesizing interaction effects, it is useful to make a distinction between a **focal predictor** and a **moderator**. 


<div style="font-size: 24px"> Interactions are usually represented with the diagrams on the right. the variable pointing directly to $Y$ is considered the focal predictor, while the variable pointing to the line is considered the moderator. </div>

<div style="font-size: 22px"> The two representation on the right are equivalent. However, depending on your hypotheses it may make more practical sense to conceptualize one variables as the focal predictor and the other as the moderator. </div>
