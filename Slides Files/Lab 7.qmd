## Background About the data

I am using some of the data from @Setti_Kahn_2024, where <span style="font-size: 12px"> (yes I am citing myself, but it makes sense for this lab, I promise 😶🫣) </span> we looked at how facets of openness to experience (both from the  [big five](https://ipip.ori.org/newNEO_FacetsTable.htm){target="_blank"} and the [HEXACO](https://ipip.ori.org/newHEXACO_PI_key.htm){target="_blank"}) predict music preference.  


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

For the data here I selected only 3 personality facets and 1 dimension of music preference.


<ul style="font-size: 22px">  


::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
<li> **Intense**: Preference for the *intense* music dimension, which includes genres such as rock, punk, metal. </li>
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<li> **Advnt**: Adventurousness facet of big 5 openness to experience. </li>

<li> **Intel**: Intellect facet of big 5 openness to experience. </li>

<li> **Uncon**: Unconventionality facet of HEXACO openness to experience. </li>
:::


::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
Higher values mean higher preference/levels of personality trait

## Dimensions of Music Preference 🎶

@Rentfrow_Gosling_2003 was a seminal study in the field of music preference, where it was found that preference for music genres cluster together (e.g., if you like *punk* music, you tend to like *metal* music). Later @Rentfrow_etal_2011 proposed a 5-factor structure of music preference: *sophisticated* (e.g., classical, blues, jazz), *unpretentious* (e.g., country and folk), intense (e.g, rock, punk, metal), mellow (e.g., pop, electronic), and *contemporary* (e.g., rap, RnB). This 5-factor structure seems to work fairly well, although I would suspect that 1 or 2 more factors would emerge with a more comprehensive selection of music genres.

This data fits the lab topic well because in the paper we had to figure out a way of dealing with high multicollinearity, and dominance analysis ended up helping a lot!

## Regression coefficients Weirdness 

<div style="font-size: 24px"> It is common practice to add covariates to regression models without giving it much thought (*adding a covariate* simply means adding additional predictors). However, some strange things 👽 may happen if you add variables too casually to regression models.

## Visulazing Multicollinearity

When strange things happen, visualizing your data (if possible) is always a good idea. 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="35%"}

```{r}
#| eval: false

#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-115

library(FabioFun)

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
<div style="font-size: 22px">  One apparent issue is that `Advnt` and `Intel` are extremely correlated ($r = .96$).

## Back to Semi-Partial Correlations

If you remember, [semi-partial correlations](https://raw.githack.com/quinix45/PSYC-7804-Regression-Lab-Slides/main/Slides%20Files/Lab%206.html#/semi-partial-correlation-by-hand){target="_blank"} calculate the correlation between $y$ and $x$ after taking out the explained variance of $z$ from only one variable.


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

ppcor::spcor(music[,1:3])[1]

```
We want to look at the first row. We can see that the relation between `Intense` and `advnt` is negative after the variance explained by `Intel` is taken out of `Advnt`.  
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
As we saw a few slides back, by themselves both variables are positively correlated with `Intense`


```{r}
#| classes: code-125

cor(music[,1:3])[1,]
```
:::


:::
::: {.column width="30%"}


::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

::: {.callout-note}
## A Word of Advice
When the sign of correlations and semi-partial correlations are different, something strange is happening. Multicollinearity may be the reason, but other possibilities exist (see [here](https://freerangestats.info/blog/2023/06/04/causality-sims){target="_blank"}). 
::: 

:::

:::
::::


## Variance Inflation Factor


Probably the quickest way to check for multicollinearity is to calculate the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each predictor. For a predictor $x$, the formula is:


$$VIF_x = \frac{1}{1 - R^2}$$

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
Importantly, the $R^2$ in the VIF formula stands for the variance explained in the predictor $x$ by *all other predictors*. 
:::


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
We use the `vif()` function from `car` to get the VIF for our regression variables 

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

car::vif(reg_coll)
```


<div style="font-size: 22px"> A VIF higher than 10 usually suggest sizable multicollinearity between predictors. </div>
:::

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
::: {.callout-note}
## Question?

Why is the VIF for our two variables the same?  
::: 
:::

:::

::::


## Another Perspective: Residuals

As shown in [Lab 5](https://raw.githack.com/quinix45/PSYC-7804-Regression-Lab-Slides/main/Slides%20Files/Lab%205.html#/calculate-partial-regression-coefficients-by-hand){target="_blank"}, regression coefficients are calculated based on the residuals of the predictors after controlling for all other predictors. But, if `Advnt` and `Intel` are so correlated, what happens to their residual after controlling fo one another? 

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

resid_Advnt <- residuals(lm(Advnt ~ Intel, music))

var(resid_Advnt)
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

resid_Intel <- residuals(lm(Intel ~ Advnt, music))

var(resid_Intel)
```
:::
::::
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<div style="font-size: 22px"> The residuals have almost no variance left! If a variable has variance of 0, it is always the same number (i.e., a constant), and cannot predict anything. A consequence of multicollinearity is that the regression coefficients that are calculated based on these residuals **should not be interpreted**. 
 </div>
:::
 
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
<center>

However, $R^2$ is untouched by multicollinearity! So, you can still interpret $R^2$ just fine with high multicollinearity.

</center>

## Dominance Analysis

Dominance analysis  [@Budescu_1993; @Azen_Budescu_2003] main application is to determine the *relative* importance of a set of predictor variables. DA provides a way of *ranking* predictors by importance.   


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
<div style="font-size: 24px"> Let's say we have three predictors, $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$. We want know which one is the most important relative to the other 2 predictors. DA looks at how much each variable adds to $R^2$ when it is added to *all possible regression subsets*. </div>
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<div style="font-size: 24px">  For Example, for $x_1$, we would look at how much the $R^2$ increases when we add it to a regression (1) with no variables , (2) only with $x_2$, (3) only with $x_3$, and (4) with $x_2$ and $x_3$.  </div>
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
Different dominance patterns (complete dominance, conditional dominance, general dominance) between variables can be established depending on the results of DA.

## Example with our Data

<div style="font-size: 24px"> In the case of our data we have 3 facets of openness to experience: adventurousness, intellect, and unconventionality. We want to know how these three variables is the most important in predicting preference for *Intense* music.  </div>


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

reg_da <- lm(Intense ~ Advnt + Intel + Uncon, music) 
DA <- dominanceAnalysis(reg_da)
summary(DA)
```
:::

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}


<ul style="font-size: 22px">  

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
let's go over the meaning of the columns in the output
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
<li>  `model`: variables in the regression.  </li>
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=4}
<li>  `level`: number of variables in the regression. </li>
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=5}
<li>  `fit`: $R^2$ value for given regression. </li>
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=6}
<li>  `remaining columns`: contribution in $R^2$ when adding variable in column. </li>
:::
</ul>



::: {.fragment fragment-index=7}
<div style="font-size: 22px"> We see that across all possible regressions, `Uncon` contributes the most $R^2$ on average, $.064$ (i.e., general dominance). </div>
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=8}
<div style="font-size: 18px; padding-top: 14px;"> Note the the $R^2$ values in the average contribution add up to the $R^2$ of the regression with all variables: </div>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

summary(reg_da)$r.squared
```
:::

:::
::::


## Additional Dominance Patterns

So, on average `Uncon` is the most important predictor or preference for *Intense* music. This is just on average across all possible regression. We can build dominance matrices with *j* rows and *i* columns.

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
A dominance matrix will contain a **1** if the variable in the row $j$ dominates the one in column $i$. You will see a **.5** if the dominance pattern between two variables cannot be established. 
:::


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<center> **Conditional Dominance** </center>

<div style="font-size: 22px"> We can check whether `Uncon` conditionally dominates the other variables, if on average it contributes more to $R^2$ across all the levels in the `level` column: </div>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

dominanceMatrix(DA, type = "conditional")
```
:::

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
<center> **Complete Dominance** </center>


<div style="font-size: 22px"> We can check whether `Uncon` completely dominates the other variables, if it contributes more to $R^2$ across **all regressions**: </div>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

dominanceMatrix(DA, type = "complete")
```
:::


:::
::::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=4}
In both cases, `Uncon` dominates the other two variables. We now have a really strong case to claim that `Uncon` is the most important predictor of preference for *Intense* music among our 3 openness facets.
:::

## Uncertainty and Inference in DA

As it is the case with any statistical procedure, our results are based on a sample, and there is uncertainty about our results (e.g., are they due to sampling error?). We can use bootstrap to check how often the dominance pattern replicates across every bootstrap sample (1000 in this case):


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125


set.seed(2341)
DA_boot <- bootDominanceAnalysis(reg_da, R = 1000)
summary(DA_boot)
```


```{r}
DA_boot <- readRDS("Additional files/DA_boot.RDS")
summary(DA_boot)
```
:::

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
Skipping over some stuff, the column that we care most about is the `rep` column. 

This column shows the proportion of bootstrap samples where the dominance pattern in the row was replicated. In general, `Uncon` seems to fairly consistently dominate all other variables.  
:::

:::
::::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
::: {.callout-note}

## DA and Multicollinearity

<div style="font-size: 18px"> If you remember $R^2$ is unaffected by multicollinearity. By extension, DA is unaffected too, as it only deals with $R^2$. Thus, DA can be a good way of making inferences about your variables when your regression coefficients are not interpretable due to high multicollinearity (which is why it came up in my case!) </div>
:::
:::

## What is Power⚡?

**Power:** Statistical power is defined as *the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis if $H_0$ is false*. Power is also known as 1 - Type II error rate. Type II error rate is denoted with $\beta$, and is the probability of failing to reject a false $H_0$. 

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
<div style="font-size: 24px"> In practice, power is used is mostly to answer the question: "how big of a sample size do I need to get a *p*-value lower than .05 given a certain effect size?" (not the most useful question if you ask me) </div>
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

</br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
<div style="font-size: 24px"> The probability of making a Type I error is always the level of significance, $\alpha$. As you know, the level of significance is almost unilaterally $.05$. So, unless specified otherwise,  $\alpha = .05$. </div>


<div style="font-size: 24px"> On the other hand, it is common to generally look for a sample size that gives a power of $\beta = .8$. This would mean that if $H_0$ is false, you would reject it $80\%$ of the times. </div>

## Power for Correlation

Calculating power for correlation, $r$, is fairly straightforward. In general calculating power involves these pieces of information:

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="37%"}
The *effect size*. Could be $r$, $d$, $f^2$, ...
:::

## Power in Regression

In regression, We calculate power based on $R^2$. More specifically, we use Cohen's $f^2$. there are two slight variations on $f^2$:



:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
When you have a single set of predictors and you want to calculate power for a regression, 

$$
f^2 = \frac{R^2}{1 - R^2}
$$
:::

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
When you want to calculate power for $\Delta R^2$ (see [Lab 6](https://quinix45.github.io/PSYC-7804-Regression-Lab-Slides/Slides%20Files/Lab%206.html#/testing-gain-in-prediction-delta-r2){target="_blank"}), whether a set of predictors *B* provides a significant improvement over an original set of predictors *A*,

$$
f^2 = \frac{R^2_{AB} - R^2_{A}}{1 - R^2_{AB}}
$$
Where $R^2_{AB} - R^2_{A} = \Delta R^2$, the improvement of adding the set of predictors *B*. 
:::

:::
::::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
Larger $R^2$ value imply larger $f^2$ values. Some guidelines are that $f^2$ of .02, .15, and .35 can be interpreted as small, medium, and large effect sizes respectively. Why do we use $f^2$? Check out the [appendix](#appendix) if you are curios!
:::


## Power For $R^2$

<div style="font-size: 22px; padding-bottom: 20px;"> Let's say that we hypothesize that depression ($X_1$), anxiety ($X_2$), and social support ($X_3$) should predict willingness to partake in novel social experiences ($Y$). We look at the literature and we expect our variables to jointly explain $15\%$ (i.e., $R^2 = .15$) of the variance in willingness to partake in novel social experiences. How many participants do we need to collect to get $80\%$ power? </div>

So, if we want to have $80\%$ power for $\Delta R^2 = .05$, we now need at least $131$ participants. We know this because 

$$
n = 125.5 + 4 + 1 = 130.5
$$ 

<div style="font-size: 22px"> where $4$ is the number of predictors in the full regression after adding $X_4$. </div>



I already linked this in the first slide, but [this page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html){target="_blank"} has very detailed explanations on how to use all the functions from the `pwr` package.

## What about power for Slopes?

<div style="font-size: 24px"> Calculating power for regression slopes is very tricky. This is because power for a single regression slope depends on its standard error. The standard error formula for a slope in a regression with two predictors is: </div>

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
$$
\mathrm{SE}_{b_1} = \frac{S_Y}{S_{X_1}}\sqrt{\frac{1 - r_{Y\hat{Y}}}{n - p - 1}}\times\sqrt{\frac{1}{1 - r^2_{12}}}
$$
<div style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 18px;"> The equation itself is not super important to know. But there are some useful things to know: </div>
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<div style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 18px;"> The one thing to keep in mind is that the smaller $\mathrm{SE}_{b_1}$, the higher your power. $n$, the sample size, is in the denominator, meaning that larger sample size decreases $\mathrm{SE}_{b_1}$...everything in order so far more $n$, more power 😀. </div>

<div style="font-size: 23px"> The part that makes it tricky is the $\sqrt{\frac{1}{1 - r^2_{12}}}$. *This is the VIF that we saw a few slides back*. Since the VIF multiplies the rest of the equation, larger VIF increases $\mathrm{SE}_{b_1}$, thus reducing power. The VIF depends on the correlation of a predictor with *all the other predictors*, which is *really* hard to guess. </div>

<div style="font-size: 23px"> **Suggestion:** If you want to do power analysis for a single regression coefficient, you should frame it in terms of how much $\Delta R^2$ you think that coefficient will produce once you add it to the regression.

## Low Power is bad Because...

Low power *is not* bad because it will be hard to get $p < .05$. Low power is bad because when you do get $p < .05$ with low power, it is likely that:


::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
<ol style="font-size: 22px">  

<li> The regression coefficients will be largely overestimated! (Type *M* error). </li>

<li> The sign of some regression coefficients will be in the wrong direction! (Type *S* error). </li>

 
</ol>
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<div style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 18px;"> You may have been "lucky" in the sense that your result was significant, but it will likely not replicate in future research. Your "lucky" result is ultimately a bad thing for the field (**!!**). And you will not see the results of many other people who ran the same analysis but did not get a significant *p*-value (publication bias!). </div>

# Appendix: Why $f^2$? The non-central $F$-distribution {#appendix}



## $f^2$ and non-central $F$-distribution

We know that $R^2$ is itself a measure of effect size; so why do we calculate $f^2$ to compute power? Chapter 9 of good old @Cohen_1988 goes in more detail, but $f^2$ is more general and convenient than $R^2$. 

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
Power for $F$-tests is calculated by comparing two things:
:::

<ol style="font-size: 22px">  

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<li>  The null $F$-distribution if $R^2 = 0$. This is a normal $F$-distribution with  $\mathrm{df_1} = k$ and $\mathrm{df_2} = n - k-1$.</li>
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
<li>  The $F$-distribution if $R^2 \neq 0$. This is an $F$-distribution with $\mathrm{df_1} = k$, $\mathrm{df_2} = n - k-1$, and a *non-centrality parameter* that we will call $L$ (in @Cohen_1988, this is referred to as $\lambda$).</li>
:::

</ol>

::: {.fragment fragment-index=4}
The formula to calculate $L$ is very straightforward once we have $f^2$:

$$
L = f^2\times(\mathrm{df_1} + \mathrm{df_2} + 1) = f^2 \times n
$$

Note that the sample size, $n$, is included in this formula, and we can solve for it such that $n = \frac{L}{f^2}$ (neat).

## The Non-central F-distribution

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}


<div style="font-size: 22px"> If $L = f^2 \times n$, then larger $L$ values imply either larger $f^2$ values, larger $n$ values, or both. </div>

<div style="font-size: 22px; padding-top:20px;"> but if $f^2 = 0$ (meaning that $R^2 = 0$), then $L = 0$. When $L = 0$, we have a normal $F$-distribution. </div>

<div style="font-size: 22px; padding-top:20px;"> You will see that increasing $L$ will shift the distribution to the right, making higher $F$-values more likely. </div>

<div style="font-size: 24px; padding-top:20px; text-align: center;"> Power analysis for $F$-test finds the critical $F$-value when $L = 0$, and checks how likely it is to get a higher $F$-value when $L = f^2 \times n$. </div>

## Power by hand

<div style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 16px;"> Let's go back to the example from some slides ago, but let's pretend that we already ran the study with $n = 100$, 3 predictors ($k = 3$), and we found a significant $R^2 = .15$ at $\alpha = .05$. How much power did we have? </div>


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
<div style="font-size: 22px"> First, we need to find the $F$-value from the null distribution after which everything is significant at $\alpha = .05$. We have $\mathrm{df_1} = 3$ and $\mathrm{df_2} = 100 - 3 -1 = 96$: </div>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

(crit_val <- qf(.95, df1 = 3, df2 = 96))
```
<div style="font-size: 22px"> Any $F$-value larger than this is going to be significant </div>
:::


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<div style="font-size: 22px"> Now, we can check how likely it is to get an $F$-value greater than our critical value from a non-central $F$-distribution where $f^2 = \frac{.15}{1 - .15} \approx .176$. The non-centrality parameter will be $L = .176 \times 100 \approx 17.6$  </div>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125

f2 <- .15/(1-.15)
L_par <- f2*100
# ncp = is the non-centrality parameter argument. It defaults to 0
pf(crit_val, df1 = 3, df2 = 96, ncp = L_par, 
   lower.tail = FALSE)
```

:::

:::
::::


::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
<div style="font-size: 22px"> So, in retrospect, we had roughly a $.95$ power. That is, we had a $95\%$ chance of getting $p < .05$ given our sample size, number of variables, and observed $R^2$. </div>
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=4}
oh, and because $n = \mathrm{df_1} + \mathrm{df_2} + 1$, you can do some algebra on the $L = f^2 \times n$ equation to find any of the other terms if you want.

## Checking with the `pwr.f2.test()` function

As always, I want to check that the result I got is also what you would get with another function. Let's use the `pwr.f2.test()`:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true 
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| classes: code-125


pwr::pwr.f2.test(u = 3, v = 96, f2 = f2)
```
`power = 0.9471734`, yup, Same result!

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
<div style="font-size: 24px"> What I just did is a general good practice. If you think you understand something but you are not $100\%$ sure and you can use *R* to run the math by hand, try it! You will gain insight in the process and solidify your knowledge. </div>

Now I know with really high certainty that my understanding of the process is accurate.
