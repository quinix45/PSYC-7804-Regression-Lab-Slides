<h2>Regression Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Regressions diagnostics are an umbrella term for methods that help you identify <em>individual data points</em> that may have an undue influence on the regression results. More often than not, these data points would be considered <strong>outliers</strong> (although, see info box below).</p>
<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
<p>Before going over the many regression diagnostics that exist, I want to show how <em>sample size</em> is an important consideration when evaluating how concerned you should be about these regression diagnostics.</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
<p><strong>When should you be careful?</strong> In general, outliers influence results more than other data points. Thus, when you have a <strong>small sample size</strong> (I would say <span class="math inline">\(N &lt; 100\)</span>?), you want to be extra careful about interpreting your results if some regression diagnostics are off.</p>

<p><strong>What is an outlier?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Determining whether a data point is an outlier is very subjective. Statistical methods may help you identify potential outliers, but <em>you</em> 🫵 have to ultimately decide what to do with those data points. Given what <em>you</em> know about your variables, would <em>you</em> considered those data points outliers? Do <em>you</em> want to remove them? If yes, why remove them? If not, why keep them? Statistics can point you in a direction, but <em>you</em> have to decide what to do and justify it.</p>

<p><strong>Small sample sizes:</strong> In small sample sizes, you should <em>always</em> check regression diagnostics, and carefully evaluate how extreme points may be influencing your results.

<section id="back-to-regression-diagnostics" class="slide level2">
<h2>Back to Regression Diagnostics</h2>
<p>As we saw from the previous examples, there are outliers that are more or less “dangerous”. <strong>Regression diagnostics</strong> give us different information (some more useful than other) about our data points. There are 3 general categories of regression diagnostics:</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:33%;">
<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
<center>
<p><strong>Leverage</strong></p>
<div style="font-size: 24px">
Leverage measures quantifies how unusual a certain observation given the full set of predictors. For example, if our predictors are <em>age</em> and whether a person is <em>pregnant</em>, it would not be unusual to separately see someone whose age is 55 and some pregnant individuals. However, it would be unusual to see someone who is <em>both</em> 55 and pregnant. Such an observation would have high leverage.
</div>
</center>
</div>
</div><div class="column" style="width:33%;">
<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
<center>
<p><strong>Distance</strong></p>
<div style="font-size: 24px">
Distance measures how far away the observed value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is from the predicted value <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span>. Residuals are a measure of distance. However, raw residuals, <span class="math inline">\(Y - \hat{Y}\)</span>, are not the best way of measuring distance, so we will see more general measures later. Regardless, high distance is more concerning than high leverage.
</div>
</center>
</div>
</div><div class="column" style="width:33%;">
<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
<center>
<p><strong>Influence</strong></p>
<div style="font-size: 24px">
In my opinion, the most important category of regression diagnostics. For each observation, influence measures tell you how much the values of your slopes would change <em>if</em> you removed that data point. The first outlier I created a few slides back had really large influence in the <span class="math inline">\(N = 50\)</span> case, as it completely changed the slope when introduced.
</div>
</center>
</div>
</div></div>
<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">
<p>You may see slightly different definitions for these 3 terms. I am drawing my definitions/examples from chapter 16 of <span class="citation" data-cites="Darlington_Hayes_2016">Darlington &amp; Hayes (<a href="#/references" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2016</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2>Quick Regression Diagnostics Summary</h2>
<div style="font-size: 26px">
Here is a quick summary of the regression diagnostics that we will look at today. In general, influence measures are more useful, because, for each data point, they tell you <em>what would happen to your results if you deleted that data point</em>.

<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<ul style="font-size: 26px">

<strong>Hat values:</strong> measure how unusual an observation is compared to the average observation. (leverage)

<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
<li>
<strong>Studentized Residuals:</strong> For each data point, it measures how large the residual is on a standardized scale (distance).

<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">

<strong>DFFITS:</strong> For each data point, it measures how large the change in the predictions, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span>, would be <em>if</em> that data point was removed (influence).

<li>
<strong>COVRATIO:</strong> For each data point, it measures how large the average change in all the standard errors of the regression coefficients would be <em>if</em> that data point was removed (influence).

</div></div>
<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">
<div style="font-size: 26px">
<strong>DFBETAS</strong> is my favorite measure because for each data point, it tells you how much each regression coefficient will change if that data point is removed. Other measures give some average, which, for most purposes, is not as informative in my opinion.

<p>Leverage is just a way of determining whether an observation is unusual, but it does not necessarily mean that the observation is problematic. I generally don’t like guidelines of “how big is too big” for regression diagnostics because they don’t generalize well to real world cases. Here, <em>Venezuela</em>’s hat value is more than twice as large as the second largest one, so somewhat big relative to all other data points.</p>
