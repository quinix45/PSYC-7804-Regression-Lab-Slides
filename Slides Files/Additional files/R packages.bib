  abstract = {A future is a programming construct designed for concurrent and asynchronous evaluation of code, making it particularly useful for parallel processing. The future package implements the Future API for programming with futures in R. This minimal API provides sufficient constructs for implementing parallel versions of well-established, high-level map-reduce APIs. The future ecosystem supports exception handling, output and condition relaying, parallel random number generation, and automatic identification of globals lowering the threshold to parallelize code. The Future API bridges parallel frontends with parallel backends following the philosophy that end-users are the ones who choose the parallel backend while the developer focuses on what to parallelize. A variety of backends exist and third-party contributions meeting the specifications, which ensure that the same code works on all backends, are automatically supported. The future framework solves several problems not addressed by other parallel frameworks in R.},

  abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) is widely used in assessment and evaluation research to explain how participants respond to item level stimuli. Several R packages can be used to estimate the parameters in various IRT models, the most flexible being the ltm (Rizopoulos 2006), eRm (Mair and Hatzinger 2007), and MCMCpack (Martin, Quinn, and Park 2011) packages. However these packages have limitations in that ltm and eRm can only analyze unidimensional IRT models effectively and the exploratory multidimensional extensions available in MCMCpack requires prior understanding of Bayesian estimation convergence diagnostics and are computationally intensive. Most importantly, multidimensional confirmatory item factor analysis methods have not been implemented in any R package. The mirt package was created for estimating multidimensional item response theory parameters for exploratory and confirmatory models by using maximum-likelihood meth- ods. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature method used in traditional EM estimation (e.g., Bock and Aitkin 1981) is presented for exploratory item response models as well as for confirmatory bifactor models (Gibbons and Hedeker 1992). Exploratory and confirmatory models are estimated by a stochastic algorithm described by Cai (2010a,b). Various program comparisons are presented and future directions for the package are discussed.},

  abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) models are a class of statistical models used to describe the response behaviors of individuals to a set of items having a certain number of options. They are adopted by researchers in social science, particularly in the analysis of performance or attitudinal data, in psychology, education, medicine, marketing and other fields where the aim is to measure latent constructs. Most IRT analyses use parametric models that rely on assumptions that often are not satisfied. In such cases, a nonparametric approach might be preferable; nevertheless, there are not many software implementations allowing to use that. To address this gap, this paper presents the R  package KernSmoothIRT . It implements kernel smoothing for the estimation of option characteristic curves, and adds several plotting and analytical tools to evaluate the whole test/questionnaire, the items, and the subjects. In order to show the package's capabilities, two real datasets are used, one employing multiple-choice responses, and the other scaled responses.},

It also describes a novel parameter expansion approach for estimating specific types of models with residual covariances, which facilitates estimation of these models in JAGS. The methodology and software are intended to provide users with a general means of estimating Bayesian SEMs, both classical and novel, in a straightforward fashion. Users can estimate Bayesian versions of classical SEMs with lavaan syntax, they can obtain state-of-the-art Bayesian fit measures associated with the models, and they can export JAGS code to modify the SEMs as desired. These features and more are illustrated by example, and the parameter expansion approach is explained in detail.},
